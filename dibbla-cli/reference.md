# Dibbla CLI — Command reference

Complete usage, arguments, and flags for all commands.

---

## context

Named login targets, one per API server. Requires the CLI release carrying P-0011.

A **context** is a `(name, API URL, token, organization)` tuple. Several exist at
once, so logging in to a customer instance no longer destroys your production
login — which is what a second `dibbla login` used to do.

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla context` or `dibbla context list` (alias `ls`) — list the contexts, marking the one in use |
| | `dibbla context use <name>` — talk to that server from now on |
| | `dibbla context current` — print the name the next command would use |
| | `dibbla context rename <old> <new>` — rename, re-keying the stored token |
| | `dibbla context rm <name>` — remove the context and its token |
| **Flags** | `--json` (on `list`) — machine-readable; each row carries `current` and `logged_in` |
| | `--force` (on `rm`) — required to remove the context in use |
| | `--context <name>` — global flag on *every* command; that invocation only, nothing stored |
| **Resolution order** | `DIBBLA_API_TOKEN`/`DIBBLA_API_URL` (shell or `./.env`) > `--context` > `DIBBLA_CONTEXT` > the context selected with `context use` > `https://api.dibbla.com`. **With `DIBBLA_API_TOKEN` set, or in CI, no config file and no keyring is read at all** — env-driven and CI usage is unchanged by contexts. |
| **Storage** | The list is a plain, editable YAML file at `~/.config/dibbla/config.yaml`, holding **no secrets**. Tokens stay in the OS keyring under per-context keys, falling back to a per-context `~/.config/dibbla/credentials.<name>.env` on hosts without a keyring. A file rather than keyring-only because no OS offers a portable "enumerate everything under this service" API, so `context list` could not otherwise be trusted. |
| **Legacy compatibility** | The context in use is mirrored into the legacy single slot — `credentials.env` on a keyring-less host, the old keyring keys otherwise. A `dibbla` binary older than contexts, and any script that sources `credentials.env`, therefore follows `dibbla context use` instead of staying on the previous server. No host gains a plaintext token it did not already have. |
| **Upgrading** | An existing login is imported into a context automatically on first run, keeping its organization pin. **No re-login, and nothing to do.** The derived name is `prod` for the default endpoint, otherwise the first label after `api.` (`api.haja.example.com` → `haja`). Names are renameable. |
| **Not context-aware** | `dibbla update` and the installer are deliberately machine-wide, not per-server. |
| **Errors** | A `--context` naming a context that does not exist is an error, and so is a `config.yaml` that will not parse — neither falls back to production silently. |

**Examples:**

```bash
dibbla login --context prod --api-key=<t>                                  # first server
dibbla login --context lab  --api-url https://api.your-domain.com --api-key=<t2>
dibbla context list                                                        # both, one marked
dibbla apps list --context prod                                            # one invocation
DIBBLA_CONTEXT=lab dibbla apps list                                        # this shell
dibbla context use lab                                                     # change the selection
dibbla context list --json | jq -r '.[] | select(.current) | .api_url'
```

## login

Authenticate with a Dibbla API server and store the token as a named context.

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla login [api_url]` |
| **Arguments** | `api_url` (optional) — API endpoint (e.g. `api.your-domain.com` or `https://api.your-domain.com`). If omitted, the URL resolves in this order: `$DIBBLA_API_URL` → `$DIBBLA_AUTH_SERVICE_URL` → **the API URL of the context you are currently on** → default `https://api.dibbla.com`. Both env names are read from `./.env` (CWD) as well as the shell environment. The context step means a bare `dibbla login` while working against a customer instance re-authenticates *there* rather than silently re-targeting production. |
| **Flags** | `--browser` — skip the interactive menu; go directly to browser OAuth. Works in non-TTY contexts (Claude Code `!` prefix, agent shells) because the flow uses a localhost callback, not stdin. |
|  | `--api-key <token>` — pass a pre-generated token; works in any context |
|  | `--api-url <url>` — explicit API endpoint URL (alternative to the positional arg; **mutually exclusive** with it — specifying both is an error). Useful in long command lines like yaml steps where positional args are easy to miss. |
|  | `--write-env` — after successful validation, write `DIBBLA_API_TOKEN` + `DIBBLA_API_URL` to `./.env` in the current working directory and ensure `.env` is listed in `./.gitignore`. Writes are atomic (tmp-file → rename) and merge in place — existing keys and comments are preserved; only the two DIBBLA keys are replaced. Unix file perms are 0600. Requires CLI ≥ v1.2.4. |
|  | `--no-keychain` — skip *all* machine-wide persistence: neither the OS keyring nor the user-level credentials file (see below) is written. Token is validated only. Combine with `--write-env` to persist to `./.env` instead. From CLI ≥ v1.2.21, plain `dibbla login` already auto-falls back to the user-level file when the keyring is unavailable, so this flag is now mainly used to *opt out* of disk persistence entirely. Requires CLI ≥ v1.2.4. |
|  | `--context <name>` — name the context to create or refresh. Without it, the context is keyed on the API URL: **the same URL refreshes the existing context, a new URL creates a new one**, so re-logging in never accumulates duplicates. **This flag shadows the global `--context`** — theirs names the context to *read*, this one names the context to *write*, so `dibbla login --context x` does not set a read override for that invocation. |
|  | `--no-switch` — store the login without making it the context in use |
|  | **Auto-fallback** (no flag) — when the OS keyring is unavailable (e.g. Linux SSH host without libsecret), `dibbla login` writes credentials to a per-context file at `~/.config/dibbla/credentials.<name>.env` (mode 0600), and mirrors the context in use to the legacy `~/.config/dibbla/credentials.env`. Both are read regardless of cwd, mirroring keychain semantics. `dibbla logout` and `dibbla uninstall` clean them up. |
| **Organization** | Re-authenticating against the same server **keeps** that context's organization pin — a re-login is not a request to change which organization you act as. Pointing an existing context at a *different* server **drops** it, because an organization id only means anything on the server that issued it. |
| **Token page** | The "create one at …" hint names the **instance you are logging in to** (`app.<its-domain>/api-keys`), not Dibbla's production portal. A token minted on the wrong instance would not work there. |
| **Interactive** | Real TTY only: picker for "Log in with browser" or "Paste an API token" |
| **Note** | In CI or sandbox sessions, set `DIBBLA_API_TOKEN` (and optionally `DIBBLA_API_URL`) in the shell environment or `./.env` — the CLI reads both, and `login` is not required. Use `DIBBLA_API_URL` as the canonical name; `DIBBLA_AUTH_SERVICE_URL` is an internal compat alias. |

**Canonical flag combinations:**

| Context | Command |
|---|---|
| Laptop (keychain only, default) | `dibbla login` (interactive) or `dibbla login --browser` |
| Laptop with project `.env` as well | `dibbla login --browser --write-env` or `dibbla login --api-key=<t> --write-env` |
| Cloud VM / SSH / Docker (no keyring), CLI ≥ v1.2.21 | `dibbla login --api-key=<t> --api-url=<url>` (auto-falls back to user-level file) |
| Cloud VM / SSH / Docker (no keyring), CLI < v1.2.21 | `dibbla login --api-key=<t> --api-url=<url> --write-env --no-keychain` |
| Bootstrap yaml step (agent-invoked) | `dibbla login --api-key=$DIBBLA_API_TOKEN --api-url=$DIBBLA_AUTH_SERVICE_URL --write-env --no-keychain` |

### logout

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla logout [--context <name>] [--all]` |
| **Flags** | `--context <name>` — log out of that context instead of the one in use. **Shadows the global `--context`**, in the same way `login`'s does. |
| | `--all` — log out of every context, remove every per-context credentials file, and delete `~/.config/dibbla/config.yaml` |
| **Output** | Removes that context's token from the OS credential store and from its credentials file, removes the context, and reports which contexts you are still logged in to. Other contexts are untouched — logging out of production does not log you out of a customer instance. |
| **Note** | With nothing configured this is a success, not an error: "log me out" on a machine that is already logged out has done its job. |

---

## org

Show and switch the organization the CLI acts as. Requires CLI ≥ v1.2.55.

On a given server your API token belongs to your **user**, not to one
organization, so switching needs no new login and no new token — the selected
organization travels with each request as an `X-Org-ID` header, and the API
verifies your membership before honoring it. With nothing selected, the API uses
your account's default organization: the one the console opens on, and no
`X-Org-ID` header is sent at all.

That is true **per server and false across servers**. An organization id is
issued by, and only means anything on, the server that issued it, so the
selection is stored **on the active context** and `org list` shows the
organizations on **that context's server**. Switching context switches
organization with it.

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla org` or `dibbla org list` — list the organizations you belong to, marking the active one |
| | `dibbla org use <name\|slug\|id>` — act as that organization from now on |
| | `dibbla org clear` — go back to your account's default |
| **Flags** | `--json` (on `list`) — emit machine-readable JSON; each entry carries `active`, and `plan` when the org has one (installs without billing omit it) |
| | `--org <id>` — global flag on *every* command; applies to that one invocation only |
| **Resolution order** | `--org` > `DIBBLA_ORG_ID` > the **active context's** pin > account default |
| **Storage** | `org use` writes the pin onto the active context in `~/.config/dibbla/config.yaml`, and mirrors it into the legacy machine-wide slot so an older binary follows. The selection survives `cd` and persists until changed — but it belongs to one context, not to the machine. On a machine with no context at all (nothing stored, env-driven usage), it falls back to the old machine-wide slot, which is what the next command would read. |
| **Matching** | `use` accepts a name, slug, or id, case-insensitively. Ids and slugs are unique so they resolve directly; a **name** shared by two organizations is reported as ambiguous rather than guessed at — pass the slug or id in that case. |
| **Exit codes** | `3` — not logged in. `4` — no organization matched what you typed. |

**Examples:**

```bash
dibbla org                              # list; → marks the active one
dibbla org use acme                     # by slug
dibbla org use "Acme Corp"              # by name
dibbla org clear                        # back to the account default

dibbla --org <id> apps list             # one invocation only, nothing stored
DIBBLA_ORG_ID=<id> dibbla deploy .      # this shell only

dibbla org list --json | jq -r '.[] | select(.active) | .slug'
```

**Errors:** acting as an organization you are not a member of fails every
command with `FORBIDDEN: Not a member of this organization`. If that appears
after someone removed you from an org you had selected, `dibbla org list` still
works — it deliberately ignores the selection so it can show you what to
switch to — and flags the stale selection in its output.

**Agent guidance:** for a user in more than one organization, confirm which one
before deploying or deleting anything — `dibbla status` prints the active
organization, and `dibbla org list` shows the alternatives. Prefer `--org <id>`
over `org use` when acting on one organization as a one-off: it leaves the
user's stored selection alone.

---

## status

Print the CLI version, the API server this CLI will talk to, and whether a valid login is configured. Useful for "where is this CLI pointing?" diagnostics — particularly across multiple shells where one has `DIBBLA_API_URL` exported and another doesn't, or after editing `.env`.

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla status` |
| **Flags** | `--json` — emit a machine-readable JSON report instead of human text |
| | `--no-validate` — skip the live token validation request (report only what's stored locally) |
| **Validation** | When a token is configured, `status` calls `POST /api/auth/v1/tokens/validate` against the resolved API URL so "logged in" reflects the *live* state of the token (revoked / expired tokens show as not logged in). Skip with `--no-validate` for offline use. |
| **Resolution order** | API URL: `DIBBLA_API_URL` > `DIBBLA_AUTH_SERVICE_URL` > keyring > credentials file > default (`https://api.dibbla.com`). Token: `DIBBLA_API_TOKEN` > keyring > credentials file > none. Org: `--org` > `DIBBLA_ORG_ID` > keyring > credentials file > account default. The `source` annotation in the output identifies which won. |
| **Exit codes** | `0` — logged in, or `--no-validate` and a token is configured. `3` — not logged in / token rejected. `1` — unexpected error (network, malformed response). |

**Human output:**

```
Dibbla CLI 1.2.24
API:     https://api.dibbla.com  (default)
Token:   configured  (source: keyring)
Org:     Acme (a1b2c3d4-...) (keyring, source: keyring)
Plan:    standard
Status:  ✅ logged in
```

The `Plan` line appears only when the validated organization has a plan
(P-0027); trials read `Plan:    trial (ends 2026-09-21T00:00:00Z)`. Under
`--no-validate` no network call is made, so no plan is shown.

The `Org` line reads `account default (none selected)` when no organization has
been selected — see [org](#org).

**JSON shape:**

```json
{
  "version": "1.2.24",
  "api_url": "https://api.dibbla.com",
  "api_url_source": "default",
  "token_configured": true,
  "token_source": "keyring",
  "org_id": "a1b2c3d4-...",
  "org_name": "Acme",
  "org_source": "keyring",
  "validated": true,
  "logged_in": true,
  "plan": "standard"
}
```

`validation_error` is added when a token was rejected; omitted otherwise.
`plan` and `trial_ends_at` are present only when validation ran and the
organization has a plan.
`org_id` / `org_name` are omitted when no organization is selected, in which
case `org_source` reads `none (account default)`. `org_name` is also absent
when the organization came from `--org` or `DIBBLA_ORG_ID`, which carry an id
but no name.

**Examples:**

```bash
dibbla status                          # human text + live validation
dibbla status --no-validate            # offline; skips network
dibbla status --json | jq '.api_url'   # script-friendly endpoint extraction
```

**Agent guidance:** before running anything that depends on a working login (`deploy`, `wf execute`, etc.), you can use `dibbla status --json` to detect a missing/invalid token and surface a clear error rather than waiting for the downstream 401. In CI, `DIBBLA_API_TOKEN` always wins over any cached keyring/file credential — `status` will report `source: env (DIBBLA_API_TOKEN)` so you can confirm CI is using the token you think it is.

---

## run

Run a `dibbla-task.yaml` pipeline locally using the dibbla-tasks steprunner.

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla run [path-or-url]` |
| **Arguments** | (omitted) — runs `./dibbla-task.yaml` from the current directory |
|  | `<local-path>` — runs the given file (work_dir defaults to the yaml's parent directory) |
|  | `<https-url>` — fetches the yaml (5 MB max, 30 s timeout) and runs it with work_dir = your invocation CWD |
| **Flags** | `--preview` — parse and print the execution plan without running anything |
|  | `--env KEY=VAL` — set/override an env var for all steps (repeatable) |
|  | `--env-file <path>` — load env vars from a `.env`-style file |
|  | `--work-dir <dir>` — override working directory for command steps |
|  | `--format plain\|gh` — output format (default `plain`; `gh` emits GitHub Actions workflow commands) |
| **Env injected into steps** | `DIBBLA_API_TOKEN`, `DIBBLA_AUTH_SERVICE_URL` (both when logged in); `DIBBLA_CMD` (path to the running dibbla binary — used by bootstrap yamls for recursive invocation regardless of PATH state) |
| **Security** | URL-fetched yamls become shell commands on the user's machine. Treat them as `curl \| bash` — only run yamls from trusted sources (e.g. `github.com/dibbla-agents/*`). |
| **Exit code** | `0` on success; `1` on step failure or setup error |

---

## template

Discover and install Dibbla templates from the hosted manifest.

Manifest URL (default): `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dibbla-agents/dibbla-public-templates/master/templates.json`. Override with `DIBBLA_TEMPLATES_URL` to point at a staging or local manifest.

Cache lives at `~/.dibbla/templates-cache.json`. Resolution is simple: a fresh cache (fetched less than 1 h ago) is used silently; otherwise the CLI fetches the manifest from the URL and rewrites the cache. If the fetch fails (offline, 404, etc.), `dibbla template list / install` returns the error — there is no stale-cache or embedded-fallback tier. Pass `--refresh` to bypass the fresh-cache short-circuit and force a network fetch.

### template list

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla template list` |
| **Flags** | `--refresh` — force re-fetch of the manifest, bypassing fresh cache |
|  | `-v`, `--verbose` — print the manifest source used (cache / network / embedded) |
| **Output** | Table: `ID  NAME  CATEGORY  DESCRIPTION` |

### template install

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla template install <id> [<dir>]` |
| **Arguments** | `id` (required) — template slug from the manifest (e.g. `getting-started`, `expense-reporter`, `crm`, `presentation`) |
|  | `dir` (optional) — destination directory; defaults to the manifest's `template_path` for that id (e.g. `./expense-reporter-template-1`) |
| **Flags** | `--force` — overwrite (reuse) the destination directory if it already exists |
|  | `--refresh` — force re-fetch of the manifest before installing |
| **Behavior** | `mkdir` destination → `chdir` into it → run the template's `bootstrap_url`. The bootstrap clones the project subtree from the templates repo into CWD and recursively invokes `dibbla run ./dibbla-task.yaml` inside the cloned directory. |
| **Refuses** | If the destination directory already exists and `--force` is not passed |
| **Exit code** | `0` on success; `1` on any failure (manifest lookup, mkdir, bootstrap pipeline) |

---

## skills

Install AI-coding-agent skills embedded in this CLI into a project (or the user's home dir). Skills are compiled into the binary via `//go:embed`, so **this command requires no network** and the installed skill always matches the version of `dibbla` the user has on `PATH`.

**Getting the skill without the CLI.** The same files are published over HTTP for agents that have no `dibbla` binary:

```bash
curl -s https://dibbla.com/.well-known/agent-skills/index.json
# → { "skills": [ { "name": "dibbla", "type": "archive",
#                   "url": ".../dibbla.tar.gz", "digest": "sha256:…" }, … ] }

# Verify before use — the digest is why it is there:
curl -sL https://dibbla.com/.well-known/agent-skills/dibbla.tar.gz -o dibbla.tar.gz
sha256sum dibbla.tar.gz          # must equal the index's `digest`
tar -xzf dibbla.tar.gz

# Just the entry point, uncompressed:
curl -s https://dibbla.com/.well-known/agent-skills/dibbla/SKILL.md
```

The published bytes are mirrored from a **tagged** CLI release, and the index's `_source.ref` names that tag — so a fetch still maps to one specific `dibbla` version rather than a floating latest. The version-locking story is the same; only the transport differs.

Coverage: Claude Code reads `.claude/skills/<id>/SKILL.md` natively (gives a `/<id>` slash command). Cursor, Opencode, Codex, Copilot, Windsurf, Aider, Zed, Warp, and RooCode read `AGENTS.md` at project root (the 2026 open standard). Gemini CLI defaults to `GEMINI.md`, which the install also writes (same content as `AGENTS.md`) so Gemini works without editing `.gemini/settings.json`.

### skills list

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla skills list` |
| **Output** | Table: `ID  DESCRIPTION` — one row per skill bundled with this CLI version |
| **Note** | The list is version-locked to the binary; upgrade the CLI to get newer skills. The HTTP mirror at `dibbla.com/.well-known/agent-skills/` is likewise pinned to a tagged release |

### skills install

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla skills install <id>` |
| **Arguments** | `<id>` (required) — id from `dibbla skills list` (currently only `dibbla`) |
| **Flags** | `--user` — install into `$HOME` instead of the current working directory |
|  | `--force` — overwrite skill files that have been edited locally. Only the embedded filenames are touched; user-added files inside `.claude/skills/<id>/` are always preserved |
|  | `--no-agents` — skip writing `AGENTS.md` and `GEMINI.md` at the target root (Claude Code only) |
| **Writes** | `<root>/.claude/skills/<id>/{SKILL.md,examples.md,guardrails.md,reference.md}` |
|  | `<root>/AGENTS.md` — marker-delimited pointer block (`<!-- >>> dibbla skill >>> -->` … `<!-- <<< dibbla skill <<< -->`). Content outside the markers is preserved byte-for-byte across reruns |
|  | `<root>/GEMINI.md` — same block, for Gemini CLI's default context filename |
| **Idempotent** | Re-running is safe. Identical bytes are no-ops (no mtime bump). CRLF vs LF line endings on AGENTS.md / GEMINI.md are preserved |
| **Atomic** | Each file is written via temp-file + `rename`. No partial skill dir if the process is killed mid-install |
| **Offline** | Yes — the skill is compiled into the binary; version always matches `dibbla --version` |
| **Exit code** | `0` on success; `1` on conflict without `--force` or any write failure |

**Canonical invocations:**

| Context | Command |
|---|---|
| Project-local install (default) | `dibbla skills install dibbla` |
| Machine-wide (every project sees it) | `dibbla skills install dibbla --user` |
| Claude Code only, no AGENTS.md / GEMINI.md | `dibbla skills install dibbla --no-agents` |
| Restore skill files after local edits | `dibbla skills install dibbla --force` |
| Inside a `dibbla-task.yaml` bootstrap step | `dibbla skills install dibbla` (with `depends_on: ["update-dibbla"]` so the CLI is fresh enough) |

---

## feedback

Send, list, and manage feedback.

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla feedback <message>` |
| **Arguments** | `message` (required) — all arguments are joined into one message |
| **Output** | `Feedback <id> received. Thank you!` |

### feedback list

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla feedback list` |
| **Output** | Table: ID, USER, DATE, MESSAGE |

### feedback delete

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla feedback delete <feedback-id>` |
| **Arguments** | `feedback-id` (required) — the feedback UUID |
| **Flags** | `--yes`, `-y` — skip confirmation |

---

## deploy

Deploy a containerized app from a directory. App URL: `https://<alias>.dibbla.com`.

### What your deploy directory needs

- **A `Dockerfile` at the root.** The CLI does not auto-detect languages, doesn't run buildpacks, and doesn't generate a Dockerfile. If the Dockerfile is missing, the backend rejects the build at the build step with logs in the error. The templates in `dibbla-agents/dibbla-public-templates` all ship a working Dockerfile — copy a pattern from one when scaffolding.
- **Whatever your Dockerfile expects** (e.g. `go.mod` + `main.go` for Go, `package.json` + source for Node, etc.). No minimum file set is enforced by the CLI.
- **An exposed port + entrypoint in the Dockerfile.** The CLI's `--port` flag only tells the platform which container port to route to; the Dockerfile's `EXPOSE` and `CMD`/`ENTRYPOINT` are what actually bind and serve traffic.

### What's excluded from the upload archive

The CLI tar.gz's the deploy directory and excludes a hardcoded list, matched on the **basename at any depth**: `.git`, `node_modules`, `.env.production`, `.env.prod`, `credentials.json`, `service-account.json`, and the four SSH private keys by **exact name** — `id_rsa`, `id_ed25519`, `id_ecdsa`, `id_dsa` (these are exact basenames, not `*_rsa`-style globs). By extension it also drops `.pem`, `.key`, `.exe`, `.dll`, `.so`, `.dylib`, `.bat`, `.cmd`, `.com`, `.msi`, `.scr`, `.pif`. `.DS_Store` is **not** on either list. `.dockerignore` is not read by the CLI (but your templates can still have one — it's honored by the backend's Docker build).

This is only the first of three filters. See "Build-context strip (`skippedDirs`)" below for the one that decides what your `Dockerfile` can actually `COPY`.

### `.dibblaignore` (server-side VCS filter)

When the deploy archive arrives at the backend, a second filter decides which files get committed to Dibbla-managed version control (the bare repo and optional GitHub mirror tied to the app). **This filter only affects VCS history — it does not change what the Docker build sees.** A file excluded from VCS by *this* filter still ships in the build context.

**That is a statement about this filter, not about the build context.** A *third*, independent filter does strip directories out of the build context during archive extraction — see "Build-context strip (`skippedDirs`)" immediately below. `.dibblaignore` neither triggers it nor exempts anything from it.

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Location** | `.dibblaignore` at the root of the deploy directory (same level as `Dockerfile`). The file itself is committed to VCS — keep it under version control. |
| **Syntax** | gitignore-style globs (powered by `sabhiram/go-gitignore`). Supports `**`, directory suffixes (`build/`), negation, etc. Example: `build/`, `**/*.log`, `coverage/`, `*.tmp`. |
| **Platform denylist (always-on)** | `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `.venv/`, `.git/`, `.env`, `.env.*`, `*.pem`, `*.key`. These are **always** filtered from VCS regardless of `.dibblaignore`, and each hit produces a warning returned in the deploy response under `vcs_filtered`. The CLI surfaces these as a recommendation to add the path to `.dibblaignore` to silence the warning. |
| **Suppressing warnings** | Add a path that hits the platform denylist (e.g. `.env`) to `.dibblaignore` and the warning goes away — same file is still excluded from VCS, but silently. User-ignored entries are checked **before** the platform denylist, so `.dibblaignore` always wins on the warning channel. |
| **Hard rejections** | The server enforces per-file and per-commit size caps. If any file exceeds the per-file cap, or the kept set exceeds the total cap, the **entire deploy fails** with `ErrCodeVCSFiltered` (HTTP 400) and a message naming the offending path. Limits are server-configured (`GitMaxFileSize`, `GitMaxCommitDelta`); typical cause is committing a generated artifact, dataset, or build output. Fix by adding the path to `.dibblaignore`. |
| **Symlinks / non-regular files** | Skipped silently. Only regular files are committed. |
| **Disabled mode** | If the platform's `VCSEnabled` flag is off for an app/org, the filter doesn't run and `.dibblaignore` has no effect. The deploy still succeeds either way. |
| **What deploy returns** | `DeployResponse.vcs_commit` — SHA written for this deploy (empty if tree unchanged or VCS disabled); `DeployResponse.vcs_filtered` — paths the platform denylist excluded; `DeployResponse.vcs_error` — non-empty if the deploy went live but the VCS commit step failed (best-effort side channel). |

**Typical contents:**

```gitignore
# Build outputs
build/
dist/
*.tsbuildinfo

# Test/coverage artifacts
coverage/
.nyc_output/

# Local env (also matched by platform denylist — listing here silences the warning)
.env
.env.local

# Editor / OS noise
.vscode/
.idea/
*.swp
.DS_Store

# Large binaries / datasets the Docker build needs but shouldn't be in VCS
data/*.parquet
fixtures/*.bin
```

**Rule of thumb:** if it's generated, secret, or large, put it in `.dibblaignore`. If the deploy response surfaces a `vcs_filtered` entry on every deploy, add it to `.dibblaignore` to clean up the log.

### Build-context strip (`skippedDirs`)

**This is the filter that decides what your `Dockerfile` can `COPY`.** It is a different mechanism from `.dibblaignore` above, with a different purpose, and it is the one that produces build failures.

**The durable rule:** the build context is your source tree **minus a set of regenerable directories**. Treat dependency and build-output directories as **absent** at `docker build` time and produce them in a build step.

While extracting the uploaded archive, `deploy-api` drops these eight directories entirely. Anything inside them is gone before `docker build` ever runs:

`node_modules/` · `.git/` · `__pycache__/` · `.venv/` · `vendor/` · `.next/` · `dist/` · `.cache/`

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **When it happens** | During archive extraction, before the build context is handed to Docker — and before the file is even counted against the deploy's file budget. |
| **What you see** | **Nothing, until the build breaks.** The strip itself is silent: no warning, no `vcs_filtered` entry, no line in the build log. The first sign is `BUILD_FAILED` on the `copy-source` step, with a buildkit message ending `"/vendor": not found`. |
| **Why it exists** | The extractor enforces hard budget caps — 50 MB archive, 200 MB extracted, **1000 files**, 10 path levels. A Go `vendor/` or JS `node_modules/` tree routinely holds thousands of files and would trip `ErrTooManyFiles` before your real source was counted. Skipping them is what keeps ordinary projects under the cap. |
| **Matching** | Prefix match on path components: a directory at the archive root or nested at any depth (`svc/vendor/…`) is stripped. Near-misses are safe — `vendored/`, `mydist/`, `distribution/`, `src/dist.go` and `vendor.json` all survive. One sharp edge: a **regular file** named exactly `dist` or `vendor` (no extension) is also stripped, because the match is on the name, not on the entry type. |
| **Scope** | Global and constant. It does not vary by org, by plan or by instance — plan entitlements bound only app and database counts. There is no opt-out, no `.dibblakeep`, and `.dibblaignore` has no influence over it. |
| **Source of truth** | `app-hosting-service/deploy-api/internal/extractor/extractor.go`, `skippedDirs`. List as of **2026-08-23**; a test pins the exact contents, so it cannot change silently. |

**The two that actually bite: `vendor/` and `dist/`.** The CLI's own exclusion list already strips `.git` and `node_modules` before upload, so those never arrive either way and their absence surprises nobody. The other six are stripped **server-side only** — they leave your machine, and then vanish.

```dockerfile
# ✗ FAILS on the platform, builds fine locally.
#   BUILD_FAILED on step copy-source, ending: "/vendor": not found
COPY vendor/ ./vendor/
RUN go build -mod=vendor -o /app ./cmd/server

# ✓ Regenerate in the build instead.
COPY go.mod go.sum ./
RUN go mod download
COPY . .
RUN go build -o /app ./cmd/server
```

```dockerfile
# ✗ FAILS — dist/ was stripped from the upload.
COPY dist/ /usr/share/nginx/html

# ✓ Build it in a stage. COPY --from=<stage> reads from an earlier
#   build stage, NOT from the upload archive, so it is unaffected.
FROM node:20 AS build
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build          # produces /app/dist inside the stage

FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=build /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
```

The same applies to Python (`pip install -r requirements.txt` rather than shipping `.venv/`) and to Next.js (`npm run build` rather than shipping `.next/`).

**Pre-deploy check:** `guardrails.md` Check 9 catches this before a deploy is attempted.

### Flags

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla deploy [path]` |
| **Arguments** | `path` (optional) — directory to deploy; default `.` |
| **Flags** | `--alias`, `-a` — custom alias name (default: directory name) |
| | `--message`, `-m` — Deploy message, used verbatim as the VCS commit subject (local bare repo and GitHub mirror). Max 500 chars; API returns 400 if exceeded. **Agents must always pass this** — treat it like a git commit subject (imperative mood, ≤72 chars). |
|| | `--force`, `-f` — force redeploy if alias exists (causes downtime) |
| | `--update`, `-u` — rolling update of existing deployment (zero downtime) |
| | `--env`, `-e` — env var `KEY=value` (repeatable) |
| | `--env-file <path>` — bulk-load env vars from a `.env`-style file. The file is the base layer; `-e` flags override individual keys (file < `-e`, same precedence as `dibbla run`). Keep the file **outside** the deploy directory (a `.env` in the deploy root is a guardrail blocker). |
| | `--cpu` — CPU request (e.g. `500m`) |
| | `--memory` — Memory request (e.g. `512Mi`) |
| | `--port` — Container port (e.g. `3000`) |
| | `--favicon` — Favicon URL (e.g. `https://example.com/favicon.ico`) |
| | `--require-login` — Require authentication to access the app |
| | `--access-policy` — Access policy: `all_members` or `invite_only` |
| | `--google-scopes` — Google OAuth scope URL (repeatable) |
| | `--target-env <name>` — Manifest env block to resolve (defaults to `prod` server-side). Only meaningful when a `dibbla.yaml` is at the deploy root. |
| | `--profile <name>` — Activate a manifest profile (repeatable). Skipped services appear in the deploy event stream. |
| | `--no-public` — Allow a deploy with no `public: true` service (worker- or cron-only deploy). |
| **Note** | `--force` and `--update` are mutually exclusive |

### Multi-service path vs single-Dockerfile path

`dibbla deploy` picks the path automatically:

- **Multi-service:** `dibbla.yaml` (or `dibbla.yml`) at the deploy root. The deploy-api parses + resolves the manifest, runs quota, builds every `build:` service in parallel, and applies the rendered K8s graph atomically (rollback-on-failure). The deploy event stream tags each event with the service name; the success response carries a `services:` map describing what got deployed.
- **Single-Dockerfile (legacy):** no manifest at the root. Behaves exactly as before: one `Dockerfile`, `--cpu` / `--memory` / `--port` flags shape the single container, response shape unchanged. Backward compatible byte-for-byte.

The two paths are mutually exclusive; the CLI fails fast (`MANIFEST_AMBIGUOUS`) if both `dibbla.yaml` and `dibbla.yml` are present.

For the manifest schema, env-aware fields, profiles, service discovery, NetworkPolicy, init containers, healthchecks, custom domains, cron jobs, and build-time secrets — see [manifest.md](manifest.md).

### Errors specific to manifest deploys

| Code | Meaning | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `MANIFEST_AMBIGUOUS` | Both `dibbla.yaml` and `dibbla.yml` are present | Remove one |
| `MANIFEST_INVALID` | Schema violation | Read the `path:` and `detail:` in the response |
| `MANIFEST_UNSUPPORTED` | Reserved top-level key (`volumes`, `networks`, `secrets`, `cron`, `init`) | Use the per-service equivalent |
| `SERVICE_NAME_INVALID` | Service name fails regex `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]{0,29}$` or is reserved | Rename |
| `BUILD_CONTEXT_MISSING` / `DOCKERFILE_MISSING` | Path inside the archive is missing | Check `build.context` / `build.dockerfile` against the archive |
| `PUBLIC_SERVICE_MISSING` | No `public: true` service and `--no-public` not set | Mark a service `public: true` or pass `--no-public` |
| `PUBLIC_MISSING_PORT` | A `public: true` service has no `port:` | Add `port:` |
| `QUOTA_EXCEEDED` | Resolved set exceeds an org quota | Trim `replicas` / `cpu` / `memory` / `volumes`, or talk to the platform operator |
| `BUILD_FAILED` | A build step failed | Check the deploy event log; if it's a missing build secret, run `dibbla secrets set <NAME> <value> -d <alias>` first |
| `DEPLOY_IN_PROGRESS` | Another deploy is in-flight for this alias | Wait or `dibbla apps cancel <alias>` |
| `PATCH_AMBIGUOUS` | `dibbla apps update --replicas N` against a multi-service deploy | Edit `dibbla.yaml` and redeploy with `--update` |
| `ALIAS_HOSTNAME_COLLISION` | Multi-public deploy would produce a hostname `<alias>-<service>.<base>` that another existing alias in the org owns | Rename either deploy |
| `ALIAS_EXISTS` | Alias is already in use; pass `--update` (rolling) or `--force` (recreate) | Pick the right mode |
| `RESERVED_ALIAS` | The chosen alias matches a platform-reserved name | Rename |
| `DEPENDS_ON_UNKNOWN` | `depends_on:` references a non-existent service | Fix the service name reference |
| `VOLUME_UNSUPPORTED` | Top-level `volumes:` block is reserved for a future schema version | Use per-service `volumes:` instead |
| `IMAGE_REGISTRY_DENIED` | `image:` references a registry not on the platform's allowlist | Pull from an allowlisted registry, or push to the org's registry |
| `INVALID_HEALTHCHECK` / `MISSING_HEALTHCHECK` | Healthcheck declaration violates the schema (multiple probes / missing required fields) | See manifest.md § 12 |
| `HEALTHCHECK_FAILED` / `HEALTHCHECK_TIMEOUT` | Probe didn't pass at deploy time | Check pod logs; relax `failure_threshold` / `initial_delay_seconds` for slow boots |
| `SERVICE_NAME_TOO_LONG` | Computed K8s name `{alias}-{service}` exceeds 63 chars | Shorten the alias or service name |
| `PLAN_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` | The org's plan is at its app or database limit (checked BEFORE any upload/build) — an at-limit org can always still redeploy its existing apps | Upgrade in the console (Org settings → Plan) or remove an app/database; the error's `Docs:` line links https://docs.dibbla.com/reference/plans |
| `TRIAL_EXPIRED` | The org's free trial has ended; deploys and creates gate while running apps keep serving | Upgrade in the console (Org settings → Plan) — the gate lifts immediately on payment |

## manifest

Local-only schema validation for `dibbla.yaml`. No server roundtrip; useful in CI, pre-commit hooks, and editor integrations.

### manifest validate

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla manifest validate [path]` |
| **Arguments** | `path` (optional) — path to a directory (looks for `dibbla.yaml` / `dibbla.yml`) or a manifest file directly. Defaults to `.`. |
| **Flags** | `--target-env <name>` — informational; resolution runs server-side. |
| | `--profile <name>` — repeatable; informational. |
| | `--no-public` — informational; the local check accepts both. |
| | `--json` — emit a structured JSON report instead of human text. |
| **Exit codes** | `0` valid (or no manifest — legacy single-Dockerfile path); `1` invalid (first error printed). |
| **Local coverage** | Schema version, service-name regex + reserved names, build/image XOR, image-must-have-tag, port range, ambiguous yaml/yml. |
| **NOT covered locally** | Env-aware resolution, quota, multi-public, cross-service references, cycle detection. Use `dibbla preview` for those. |

**Examples:**
```bash
dibbla manifest validate                 # validate ./dibbla.yaml
dibbla manifest validate ./myapp         # validate ./myapp/dibbla.yaml
dibbla manifest validate ./dibbla.yaml   # validate the file directly
dibbla manifest validate --json          # machine-readable
```

---

## preview

Server-authoritative dry run. Uploads the archive, lets the server resolve the manifest + run quota, returns the resolved shape — no build, no apply, no deploy slot consumed.

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla preview [path]` |
| **Arguments** | `path` (optional) — directory; default `.` |
| **Flags** | `-a`, `--alias <name>` — override directory-name alias. |
| | `--target-env <name>` — manifest env (defaults to `prod` server-side). |
| | `--profile <name>` — repeatable manifest profile. |
| | `--no-public` — allow worker- or cron-only deploys. |
| | `--port <N>` — forwarded as `port` field; used by the no-manifest synthesizer. |
| | `--json` — emit raw `PreviewResponse` JSON. |
| **Exit codes** | `0` valid; `1` invalid (errors printed) or HTTP/transport failure. |
| **Output** | Active services + replica counts, public service name, env-aware-resolved values, skipped services with reason, quota-check result. |

**Examples:**
```bash
dibbla preview                                          # ./, env=prod
dibbla preview ./myapp --target-env staging
dibbla preview --profile mailcatcher --profile metrics
dibbla preview --no-public                              # cron-only deploy is OK
dibbla preview --json | jq '.active_services'
```

## apps

### apps list

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla apps list` |
| **Output** | Table: ALIAS, URL, STATUS, LAST DEPLOYED |

### apps update

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla apps update <alias>` |
| **Arguments** | `alias` (required) — deployment alias |
| **Flags** | `--env`, `-e` — env var `KEY=value` (repeatable) |
| | `--env-file <path>` — bulk-load env vars from a `.env`-style file (base layer; `-e` overrides individual keys, file < `-e`) |
| | `--replicas` — desired replica count |
| | `--cpu` — CPU request/limit (e.g. `500m`, `1`) |
| | `--memory` — Memory request/limit (e.g. `256Mi`, `512Mi`) |
| | `--port` — Container port (1–65535) |
| | `--favicon` — Favicon URL (use `""` to clear) |
| | `--require-login` — Require login: `true` or `false` |
| | `--access-policy` — Access policy: `all_members`, `invite_only`, or `""` to clear |
| | `--google-scopes` — Google OAuth scope URL (repeatable, use `""` to clear) |
| **Rule** | At least one of: `--env`, `--env-file`, `--replicas`, `--cpu`, `--memory`, `--port`, `--favicon`, `--require-login`, `--access-policy`, `--google-scopes` required |

### apps delete

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla apps delete <alias>` |
| **Arguments** | `alias` (required) |
| **Flags** | `--yes`, `-y` — skip confirmation |

### apps restart

Trigger a K8s rolling restart of one service in a multi-service deployment. Idempotent — calling twice in a row produces two pod rollouts. For single-service / legacy deployments, the conventional service name is `app`.

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla apps restart <alias> --service <name>` |
| **Arguments** | `alias` (required) — deployment alias |
| **Flags** | `-s`, `--service <name>` (required) — service to restart; regex `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]{0,29}$` |
| | `-q`, `--quiet` — print only the alias on success (script-friendly) |
| | `--json` — print the JSON response body |
| **Output** | Default: `✓ rolling restart triggered for <alias>/<service>`. JSON: full response. |
| **Errors** | `404` (service not found) prints a hint to run `dibbla apps list`. `SERVICE_NAME_INVALID` is caught locally before the HTTP call. |

**Examples:**
```bash
dibbla apps restart myapp --service worker
dibbla apps restart myapp -s web --quiet
dibbla apps restart myapp -s redis --json
```

### apps get

Show one deployment's record. This is the command `logs --pod-stream` 404s point at ("check `dibbla apps get <alias>`") to see which services exist.

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla apps get <alias>` |
| **Arguments** | `alias` (required) — regex `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]{2,62}[a-z0-9]$`, validated locally (zero requests on failure, exit 5) |
| **Flags** | `--json` — print the raw API document verbatim |
| **Output** | Default: URL, status, deployed/updated times, replicas, size, health, login policy; for multi-service apps a per-service breakdown with ready/replica counts and a `stateful` marker |
| **Errors** | `404` exit 4 with a hint to `apps list`; `401/403` exit 3 |

**Examples:**
```bash
dibbla apps get myapp
dibbla apps get myapp --json | jq '.services[].name'
```

---

## apps checks

Inspect and run an app's application checks (`dibbla-checks.yaml`). Alias is always positional; the check id is always a `--check` flag (same shape as `apps restart <alias> --service <name>`).

These commands **operate** checks; they do not author them. For the file's schema — the four kinds, the `identity_grant` rule that `click`/`fill` depend on, `judge.output` as a type declaration, `secret_ref`, and why this is not a `healthcheck:` — see [manifest.md § 22](manifest.md). For what the platform does with the file at runtime (snapshot promotion, the two enablement switches, `nightly` jitter, isolation, result codes, the four notification events, emergency disable) see [platform.md § 8.7](platform.md).

**Exit codes are the product outcome, not just success/failure** — `run` exits 0 pass, 8 fail, 9 error, 10 indeterminate, 12 canceled, 13 skipped_concurrent, so CI gates on the code without scraping output. Transport failures keep the CLI-wide ladder: 3 auth/permission, 4 not found, 5 request validation, 6 conflict, 7 timeout, 1 unexpected. A check that *finds* a problem (exit 8) is the check working, not the command failing.

### apps checks list

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla apps checks list <alias>` |
| **Flags** | `--json` — print the raw API document (one JSON document) |
| **Output** | Runtime enabled state, config revision, one table row per definition (ID, KIND, SCHEDULE, CLASSIFICATION, ENABLED, NAME) |
| **Notes** | `configured: false` (org enabled, no dibbla-checks.yaml) is exit 0 — "no checks" is an answer. Org capability disabled is a 404 (exit 4) with code `APPLICATION_CHECKS_DISABLED` |

### apps checks run

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla apps checks run <alias>` |
| **Arguments** | `alias` (required) |
| **Flags** | `--check <id>` — run only this check (default all); regex `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]{0,62}$`, validated locally (exit 5, zero requests) |
| | `--async` \| `--follow` — return once accepted, or poll and stream. Mutually exclusive |
| | `-q`, `--quiet` \| `--json` — mutually exclusive |
| **Output** | Default: polls to terminal, prints `✅ pass — execution acx_…` (or the matching outcome), terminal code, duration. `--quiet`: `<execution-id> [outcome]`. `--json` (sync): one document with `outcome` + `exit_code` + the final `execution`. `--async --json`: the parent execution object as answered by the run endpoint. `--follow --json`: NDJSON — one `execution_created` line, one `execution_status` line per status change, exactly one terminal `summary` line carrying `outcome` and `exit_code` |
| **Errors** | Product outcomes per the table above; transport ladder otherwise; poll timeout exits 7 and names the execution id (it keeps running server-side) |

**Examples:**
```bash
dibbla apps checks run myapp --check home-page        # exit 0 = pass, 8 = fail
dibbla apps checks run myapp --async --quiet          # prints the execution id
dibbla apps checks run myapp --follow --json | jq -c 'select(.type=="summary")'
```

### apps checks history

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla apps checks history <alias>` |
| **Flags** | `--check <id>` — one check's page (default: every configured check, merged newest-first) |
| | `--since <duration>` — client-side window filter, e.g. `24h` |
| | `--limit <N>` — client-side cap; also sent as the server-side page size |
| | `--json` — one JSON document. With `--check`: the server page verbatim (`runs` + `next_cursor`). Without: the CLI's own envelope (`schema_version`, `deployment_alias`, `runs`) around **the server's own run documents**, key for key — the envelope differs because N pages cannot share one `next_cursor`, the runs do not differ. **First release after `v1.2.65`**; on `v1.2.65` and earlier the merged path re-serialised through a smaller struct, silently dropping `execution_id`, `transport_status`, `assertion_status`, `check_fingerprint`, `evidence_refs`, `evidence_gaps` and inventing `finished_at: 0001-01-01` / `duration_ms: 0` for unfinished runs. Tell the user to check `dibbla --version`, and on the older build to use `--check` per check when they need every field |
| **Output** | Default: table of STARTED, CHECK, OUTCOME, CODE, SUMMARY (typed result documents — stable `code`, bounded prose `summary`) |

### apps checks enable / disable

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla apps checks enable <alias>` / `dibbla apps checks disable <alias>` |
| **Flags** | `-y`, `--yes` — skip confirmation. `--check` — **rejected** (exit 5, zero requests): enablement is app-wide until the API grows per-check enablement |
| **Requires** | owner/admin. Enable also requires configured checks (a 400 with the server's code otherwise, exit 5) |
| **Output** | `✓ application checks enabled for <alias> (settings version N)` |
| **Errors** | Version conflict on concurrent edits is 409 → exit 6 |

---

## logs

Print runtime logs for a deployed app, sourced from the platform's Loki backend. By default returns the last 15 minutes and exits. **This is the primary way to debug a deployed app without redeploying** — when a deploy succeeds but the app 500s, errors out, or behaves unexpectedly, run `dibbla logs <app>` first rather than adding `console.log` and redeploying.

**Two scopes, controlled by `--service`:**

- **Accumulated / deployment-wide (default — omit `--service`):** returns lines from every service in the deployment, interleaved by timestamp. Each `--json` entry carries a `labels.service` field so you can attribute lines to the originating container. Use this as the entry point — "what is the whole deployment doing?" or "which service is producing this error?".
- **Single service (`-s <name>` / `--service <name>`):** filters server-side to one named service from a multi-service `dibbla.yaml`. Use this once the aggregated view points at a specific service.

For a single-service deployment the two scopes return the same lines.

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla logs <app>` |
| **Arguments** | `app` (required) — alias of the deployed app whose logs to fetch |
| **Flags** | `--since <duration>` — window to fetch (Go duration; default `15m`, server cap `24h`) |
| | `-f`, `--follow` — stream new lines as they arrive (after the `--since` backfill, if any) |
| | `-n`, `--tail <N>` — show only the last N lines instead of the `--since` window |
| | `--grep <regex>` — server-side regex line filter (LogQL `|~`) |
| | `--limit <N>` — cap lines fetched in range mode (server caps the value) |
| | `--json` — emit raw NDJSON (one Loki entry per line) instead of the human format |
| | `--no-color` — disable colour in the human format (set this for non-TTY callers) |
| | `-s`, `--service <name>` — filter to a single service in a multi-service deployment (forwarded as `?service=`) |
| | `--pod-stream` — stream pod logs via the K8s API instead of Loki (requires `--service`); output is text/plain with `[<pod>] ` line prefixes |
| **Errors** | Returns 404 for apps outside your organisation, or for `--pod-stream` when no pods match the service. Returns 503 if Loki isn't configured (`LOKI_URL` unset) or `--pod-stream` is used and Kubernetes isn't configured. |

### Two log sources

`dibbla logs` has two backends; pick based on what's available and what you need:

| | Loki (default) | K8s pod-stream (`--pod-stream`) |
|---|---|---|
| Server requirement | `LOKI_URL` configured | Kubernetes clientset configured |
| Output format | NDJSON entries with `ts`, `line`, `labels` | text/plain, one `[<pod>] ` line per row |
| Cross-service | Yes (omit `--service` to see all) | No (`--service` is required) |
| Multi-pod | Merged by Loki | Merged client-side; line ordering is per-pod |
| Time range | `--since`, `--tail` | `--tail` only |
| Grep | Yes (LogQL `|~`) | No (filter client-side) |
| Long retention | Yes (Loki retention) | No (just current pod logs) |

**Examples:**

```bash
dibbla logs expense-reporter                         # last 15 min, ALL services merged
dibbla logs expense-reporter --since 24h             # last 24 hours, all services
dibbla logs expense-reporter --since 10m -f          # backfill 10 min, then follow (all services)
dibbla logs expense-reporter -n 200                  # last 200 lines, all services
dibbla logs expense-reporter --grep "timeout"        # server-side filter, all services
dibbla logs expense-reporter --json | jq '{svc: .labels.service, line}'  # attribute lines per service
dibbla logs expense-reporter --service worker -f     # narrow to one service after triage
```

**Agent guidance:** when a deploy succeeds but the app misbehaves, the debugging loop is `dibbla logs <app> --since 30m --grep <error-substring>` → identify the failure → fix code → redeploy with `--update`. Only resort to "redeploy with extra logging" if the existing logs don't surface the issue.

## db

### db list

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla db list [--quiet | -q]` |
| **Flags** | `--quiet`, `-q` — names only, one per line (scripting) |

### db create

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla db create [name]` or `dibbla db create --name <name>` |
| **Arguments** | `name` (optional as position) — database name |
| **Flags** | `--name` — database name (alternative to argument) |
| | `--deployment <alias>` — scope the database and the auto-created secret to a specific deployment (omit for global) |
| **Rule** | Name required via argument or `--name` |
| **Name rules** | Lowercase letters, digits, and underscores only; must start with a letter; max 63 chars. Pattern: `^[a-z][a-z0-9_]{0,62}$`. Hyphens and uppercase are rejected. |
| **Secret name** | The auto-created secret is **always** `DATABASE_URL_<UPPERCASED_UNDERSCORED_NAME>` — the database name uppercased with every non-alphanumeric character turned into `_` (e.g. `DATABASE_URL_NEXTJS_TODO_DB` for database `nextjs_todo_db`). This holds **regardless of scope**: `--deployment` changes only whether the database and its secret are org-wide or scoped to one deployment, never the secret's name shape — it is never a bare `DATABASE_URL`. App code must read `DATABASE_URL_<NAME>`. |

### db delete

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla db delete <name>` |
| **Arguments** | `name` (required) |
| **Flags** | `--yes`, `-y` — skip confirmation |
| | `--quiet`, `-q` — errors only (scripting) |

### db dump

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla db dump <name> [--output <file> | -o <file>]` |
| **Arguments** | `name` (required) |
| **Flags** | `--output`, `-o` — output path; default `<name>.dump` |
| **Output** | Custom-format pg_dump archive |

### db restore

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla db restore <name> --file <path>` or `-f <path>` |
| **Arguments** | `name` (required) — target database |
| **Flags** | `--file`, `-f` (required) — path to dump file |

### db connect

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla db connect <name> [--quiet | -q]` |
| **Arguments** | `name` (required) — database name |
| **Flags** | `--quiet`, `-q` — print only the connection string (scripting) |
| **Output** | psql-compatible connection string via the Dibbla database proxy, authenticated with your **personal API token** as the password (for human/CLI use). Apps don't use this — they read the auto-injected `DATABASE_URL_<NAME>` secret, which goes through the same proxy but with a managed per-database proxy secret. Host and `sslmode` are derived from `DIBBLA_API_URL`: the `api.` host maps to the matching `db.` host on the same base domain, so `api.dibbla.com` → `db.dibbla.com` (`sslmode=require`). `localhost`/`127.0.0.1` map to `sslmode=disable`. Override any of it with `DIBBLA_DB_HOST`, `DIBBLA_DB_PORT`, `DIBBLA_DB_SSLMODE`. |

### TLS for application database clients

The injected connection string (`DATABASE_URL_<NAME>`) reaches Postgres **through the Dibbla database proxy** at a public hostname (`db.<base-domain>`) that presents a **publicly-valid TLS certificate**. The URL already carries `sslmode=require`. **Use the injected value as-is** — the certificate verifies normally, so standard clients connect with no special SSL configuration.

Do **not**:
- strip `sslmode` from the URL,
- set `ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false }` or `sslmode=no-verify`,
- set `sslmode=disable`.

Those were workarounds for an older self-signed-cert setup. They are no longer needed and only weaken security — the cert is valid and should be verified.

The proxy speaks standard Postgres TLS negotiation (in-band SSL upgrade), so **every** driver works — you do **not** need PostgreSQL 17 "direct TLS" (`sslnegotiation=direct`).

#### Node.js — `pg`

```js
import { Pool } from "pg";

export const pool = new Pool({
  connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL_MY_DB,
});
```

If your `pg` version doesn't enable TLS from the URL's `sslmode`, add `ssl: true` (full verification — the cert is valid, so no `rejectUnauthorized: false` needed).

#### Python — `psycopg2` / `psycopg`

```python
import os
import psycopg2

conn = psycopg2.connect(os.environ["DATABASE_URL_MY_DB"])
```

The `sslmode=require` in the URL is honoured directly; `psycopg` v3 is the same.

#### Prisma

Use the injected value unchanged — no `?sslmode=no-verify`, no driver adapter:

```env
DATABASE_URL="${DATABASE_URL_MY_DB}"
```

> The injected credential is a **Dibbla-managed per-database proxy secret**, not your Postgres role password, and only works **through the proxy** — don't try to use it to connect to a database host directly.

---

## storage

Managed S3-compatible object storage — buckets provisioned and operated like
databases. Alias: `dibbla buckets`. Creating a bucket provisions credentials
**scoped to exactly that bucket** (they cannot read or list any other bucket)
plus a **hard quota**, and injects four secrets automatically:
`STORAGE_<NAME>_ENDPOINT`, `STORAGE_<NAME>_BUCKET`,
`STORAGE_<NAME>_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `STORAGE_<NAME>_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` — where
`<NAME>` is the bucket name uppercased with hyphens turned into underscores
(bucket `my-uploads` → `STORAGE_MY_UPLOADS_*`). App code reads those env vars
and speaks plain S3 (any SDK; path-style, region `us-east-1`).

On an instance without managed storage configured, every command fails with
`STORAGE_NOT_CONFIGURED` (503) — that's the server saying the feature is off,
not a CLI bug.

### storage list

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla storage list [--quiet | -q]` |
| **Flags** | `--quiet`, `-q` — names only, one per line (scripting) |

### storage create

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla storage create [name]` or `dibbla storage create --name <name>` |
| **Arguments** | `name` (optional as position) — bucket name |
| **Flags** | `--name` — bucket name (alternative to argument) |
| | `--deployment <alias>` — scope the bucket and its `STORAGE_*` secrets to a specific deployment (omit for org-global) |
| | `--size <quota>` — hard quota, e.g. `5Gi`, `500Mi` (default 5Gi; server-side ceiling applies) |
| | `--expire-days <n>` — auto-delete objects older than n days (0 = never) |
| **Name rules** | 3–48 chars, lowercase letters, digits and hyphens; must start **and** end alphanumeric. Pattern: `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]{1,46}[a-z0-9]$`. Underscores and uppercase are rejected. Reserved names (`workflows`, `files`, `cnpg-backups`, `workflow-artifacts`) are refused. |
| **Quota** | The quota is **hard** — uploads beyond it fail with an S3 error. Choose `--size` for real usage. |

### storage delete

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla storage delete <name>` |
| **Arguments** | `name` (required) |
| **Flags** | `--yes`, `-y` — skip confirmation |
| | `--force` — delete even if the bucket still holds objects (irreversible) |
| | `--quiet`, `-q` — errors only (scripting) |
| **Behaviour** | Deletes the bucket, its scoped credentials **and** the four injected secrets. A non-empty bucket is refused without `--force`. |

### storage rotate

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla storage rotate <name> [--no-restart]` |
| **Arguments** | `name` (required) |
| **Flags** | `--no-restart` — skip restarting the bound deployment's services |
| **Behaviour** | Re-mints the scoped credentials and re-syncs the injected secrets. **Rotation is restart-coupled**: pods read secrets via env at start, so the bound deployment's services are restarted automatically to pick up the new key. With `--no-restart`, running pods keep the old — now invalid — key until you restart them yourself (`dibbla apps restart`). |

### storage info

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla storage info` |
| **Output** | Table of every bucket: size, object count, quota. Size figures come from the store's usage accounting and can lag by a scan cycle. |

### storage credentials

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla storage credentials <name> [--deployment <alias>] [--quiet | -q]` |
| **Arguments** | `name` (required) — bucket name |
| **Flags** | `--quiet`, `-q` — print only the export lines (for `eval`) |
| | `--deployment <alias>` — where the bucket's secrets are scoped (omit for org-global) |
| **Output** | Shell `export` lines (`AWS_ENDPOINT_URL`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `DIBBLA_BUCKET`) read from the injected secrets, for human use with `aws`/`mc`/`rclone`: `eval "$(dibbla storage credentials mybucket -q)"`. There is no `storage connect` — S3 has no psql analog to wrap. |

---

## secrets

Secrets have three scopes:

- **Global** (no `--deployment`) — visible to every deployment in the org.
- **Deployment-wide** (`--deployment <alias>` or `-d <alias>`, no `--service`) — visible to every service in the deployment.
- **Per-service** (`-d <alias> --service <name>` or `-s <name>`) — visible only to the named service container, not to its peers.

Precedence at deploy time (highest wins): per-service > deployment-wide > global. So a `DATABASE_URL` set globally can be overridden for one deployment by `dibbla secrets set DATABASE_URL ... -d myapp`, and that in turn can be overridden for the worker container by `dibbla secrets set DATABASE_URL ... -d myapp --service worker`.

`--service` requires `--deployment`. Setting `--service` without `-d` is rejected client-side. Service names follow the regex `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]{0,29}$`.

### secrets list

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla secrets list [--deployment <alias> | -d <alias>] [--service <name> | -s <name>]` |
| **Flags** | `--deployment`, `-d` — list secrets for this deployment; omit for global |
| | `--service`, `-s` — scope to a single service (requires `-d`) |
| **Output** | Table: NAME, DEPLOYMENT, SERVICE, UPDATED. Service `(all)` means deployment-wide; deployment `(global)` means org-global. |

### secrets set

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla secrets set <name> [value] [-d <alias>] [-s <service>]` |
| **Arguments** | `name` (required), `value` (optional — if omitted, read from stdin) |
| **Flags** | `--deployment`, `-d` — attach to deployment; omit for global |
| | `--service`, `-s` — scope to a single service (requires `-d`) |
| **Notes** | Per-service secrets stack on top of deployment-wide and global; the higher-precedence value wins inside the service container. |

### secrets import

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla secrets import <file> [-e KEY=value ...] [-d <alias>] [-s <service>] [--dry-run]` |
| **Arguments** | `file` (required) — a `.env`-style file |
| **Flags** | `--env`, `-e` — override a single `KEY=value` on top of the file (repeatable; file < `-e`) |
| | `--deployment`, `-d` — import into a deployment; omit for global |
| | `--service`, `-s` — scope to a single service (requires `-d`) |
| | `--dry-run` — list the keys that would be set (names + scope only, no values, no network) |
| **Behaviour** | Bulk-loads every `KEY=value` into the secrets store **without a redeploy**. Every key is validated up front against `^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]{0,127}$`; if any is invalid, nothing is sent. The server upserts, so import is idempotent and re-runnable. On a mid-loop API error it stops and reports how many succeeded and which key failed. **Values are never printed** — output is key names + a count. |
| **Notes** | Keep the `.env` file **outside** the deploy directory (or in `.dibblaignore`): a `.env` in the deploy root is a pre-deploy guardrail blocker, stripped from VCS. |

### `.env` file grammar (`--env-file`, `secrets import`)

Files are parsed by `godotenv`, the same parser `dibbla run --env-file` uses.
The accepted grammar, exactly:

| Form | Result |
|---|---|
| `KEY=value` | the basic form |
| `export KEY=value` | accepted; `export ` is ignored |
| `# comment` | whole-line comments are skipped |
| `KEY=value # trailing` | trailing comments are stripped → `value` |
| blank lines | skipped |
| `KEY=` | empty string, not "unset" |
| `KEY=a=b=c` | split on the **first** `=` → `a=b=c` |
| `KEY="has spaces"` | quotes are stripped |
| `KEY="line1\nline2"` | double-quoted values may span lines |
| `KEY="pre ${OTHER} post"` | **`${VAR}` is expanded** inside double quotes |
| `KEY='no ${EXPANSION}'` | single quotes are **literal** — nothing expands |

Two things that bite:

- **A `$` in a double-quoted value is expansion syntax, not a literal.** A
  password like `"p$assw0rd"` loses `$assw0rd` (an undefined variable expands to
  empty). Single-quote values that contain `$`: `KEY='p$assw0rd'`.
- **A `-` in a *name* is a parse error**, not an invalid-name error: godotenv
  fails the whole file with `unexpected character "-" in variable name`. Names
  that parse but break the secret rule (leading digit, `.`, space, leading `_`)
  are caught by `secrets import`'s own up-front validation instead.

### secrets get

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla secrets get <name> [-d <alias>] [-s <service>]` |
| **Arguments** | `name` (required) |
| **Flags** | `--deployment`, `-d` — for deployment-scoped secret |
| | `--service`, `-s` — for per-service secret (requires `-d`) |
| **Output** | Secret value only (pipeline-friendly) |
| **Notes** | Returns the exact (deployment, service) row — there is no implicit fall-through. To inspect what a service container actually sees at runtime, exec into the pod or use `dibbla logs <alias> --service <svc>` after a redeploy. |

### secrets delete

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla secrets delete <name> [-d <alias>] [-s <service>] [--yes | -y]` |
| **Arguments** | `name` (required) |
| **Flags** | `--deployment`, `-d` — for deployment-scoped secret |
| | `--service`, `-s` — for per-service secret (requires `-d`) |
| | `--yes`, `-y` — skip confirmation |

---

## admin

Platform-admin commands gated by `DIBBLA_ADMIN_TOKEN`. The user's normal API token is **not** used; admin endpoints require a separate static token configured by the platform operator. If the token isn't configured server-side, the endpoints don't exist (the CLI will see a 404).

### admin reconcile

Force one synchronous orphan-resource sweep on the deploy-api instance. The reconciler normally runs on a periodic schedule; this command runs one tick immediately and prints the names of the K8s objects it deleted (or would have, depending on operator config).

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `DIBBLA_ADMIN_TOKEN=<tok> dibbla admin reconcile` |
| **Flags** | `--json` — emit the raw JSON sweep result instead of human text |
| **Auth** | Reads `DIBBLA_ADMIN_TOKEN` from env. The user's API token is NOT used. `DIBBLA_API_URL` (or default) selects the deploy-api instance. |
| **Output** | `deployments`, `services`, `ingresses` — counts plus the names of the swept objects. |
| **Errors** | Missing token → exit 1 with prompt. 401 → "unauthorized; check DIBBLA_ADMIN_TOKEN". 404 → "admin endpoints not enabled on this deploy-api instance". 503 → "reconciler not configured". |

**Examples:**
```bash
DIBBLA_ADMIN_TOKEN=$ADMIN_TOKEN dibbla admin reconcile
DIBBLA_ADMIN_TOKEN=$ADMIN_TOKEN dibbla admin reconcile --json | jq '.deployments'
```

---

## workflows

Alias: `wf`. All workflow commands support these persistent flags:

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--output`, `-o` | Output format: `yaml`, `json`, or `table` |
| `--quiet`, `-q` | Minimal output |
| `--verbose`, `-v` | Show HTTP request/response details |

Every command in the workflow family (`workflows`/`wf`, `nodes`, `edges`, `inputs`, `tools`, `revisions`, `functions`) exits with a code that identifies the failure class, so a script can branch without scraping stderr:

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0` | Success |
| `1` | Everything else — network failure, unreadable file, bad flags |
| `3` | Not authorised (401/403) |
| `4` | Not found (404) |
| `5` | Validation or patch failure (422) |
| `6` | Already exists (409) |
| `7` | Timeout (408) |

Validation failures are printed grouped by rule, with the offending YAML location and the command that resolves it.

> **What is a workflow?** A typed DAG of function calls authored in slim YAML. A *workflow* is a stable name; a *revision* is an immutable snapshot of its YAML. `HEAD` is the mutable working revision that every command below modifies unless `--revision` is passed. See [workflows.md](workflows.md) for the model, the YAML format, node-type roles, validator errors, and canonical shapes.

### workflows list

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla workflows list` |
| **Output** | Table: NAME, LABEL, NODES, HAS_API (default); or JSON/YAML with `-o` |

### workflows get

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla workflows get <name>` |
| **Arguments** | `name` (required) — workflow name |
| **Flags** | `--revision` — get a specific revision |
| **Output** | YAML (default) or JSON with `-o json` |

### workflows create

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla workflows create --file <path>` or `-f <path>` |
| **Flags** | `--file`, `-f` (required) — workflow definition file (YAML or JSON) |

### workflows update

Full replacement of HEAD — not a merge. The CLI sends an `If-Match` header containing the current ETag (fetched automatically from the existing workflow), so concurrent edits return `412` instead of silently clobbering whoever wrote last.

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla workflows update <name> --file <path>` |
| **Arguments** | `name` (required) — workflow to replace |
| **Flags** | `--file`, `-f` (required) — workflow definition file (YAML or JSON) |
|  | `--force` — override the optimistic-concurrency check; overwrite even if HEAD has moved since the CLI last read it. Skip the `If-Match` precondition. |
| **Errors** | `412 Precondition Failed` with a JSON body of shape `{"error":"…","current_etag":"…","received_etag":"…"}` when another writer modified HEAD between the CLI's pre-update `wf get` and the `PUT`. Re-fetch with `wf get`, re-apply your changes, and retry — or pass `--force` to overwrite. |

**Agent guidance:** prefer the pull-merge-retry path over `--force`. The 412 is the system telling you a teammate (or the browser editor) shipped a change you didn't see; overriding it with `--force` may delete their work. Use `--force` only for known-overwrite cases (e.g. a CI job re-applying a stable golden definition).

### workflows delete

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla workflows delete <name>` |
| **Arguments** | `name` (required) |
| **Flags** | `--yes` — skip confirmation |

### workflows validate

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla workflows validate --file <path>` or `-f <path>` |
| **Flags** | `--file`, `-f` (required) — workflow definition to validate (not saved) |
| **Behavior** | Pure validation — never persists. Safe to run repeatedly during authoring. Returns the list of validation rule violations (`UNSATISFIED_INPUT`, `UNKNOWN_FUNCTION`, etc. — see [workflows.md](workflows.md) §10). |
| **Exit codes** | `0` valid; `5` invalid (findings printed grouped by rule); `1` on a transport or file error. Usable directly as a CI gate. |

### workflows execute

Execute a workflow over HTTP. Synchronous by default — the call blocks until the workflow's `api_response` node fires (server-side timeout: 30 min). For long-running or fire-and-forget runs, use `--async` to detach, or `--follow` to detach and tail logs in one command.

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla workflows execute <name>` |
| **Arguments** | `name` (required) — workflow to execute |
| **Flags** | `--data` — inline JSON data to send |
| | `-F`, `--file` — JSON data file (note: short flag is `-F`, not `-f`, to free `-f` for `--follow`) |
| | `--node` — target a specific API node ID (only required when the workflow has multiple `api` nodes) |
| | `--async` — fire-and-forget: return `response_metadata` immediately and let the run continue in background |
| | `-f`, `--follow` — implies `--async`. Tail live logs to stdout until the run completes, then print the api_response payload. Exits 0 on the server-emitted `run_completed` sentinel |
| **Body shape** | JSON object **keyed by the `inputs:` names declared on the target `api` node** (e.g. `{"question":"…"}` if the api node has `inputs: [question]`). |
| **Response shape (sync, default)** | JSON object keyed by the `inputs:` names declared on the linked `api_response` node, plus `response_metadata: {run, node, workflow, timestamp}`. |
| **Response shape (`--async`)** | `{"response_metadata": {"run":"…", "node":"…", "workflow":"…"}}` only — the run is still in flight. Pair with `wf logs <runId> --follow` and/or `wf runs output <runId>` to retrieve progress and final output. |
| **Response shape (`--follow`)** | NDJSON log lines streamed to stdout, then a final JSON object identical to the sync response once the run finishes. |

**Examples:**
```
dibbla wf execute weather --data '{"question":"Berlin?"}'
dibbla wf execute weather --data '{"question":"…"}' --async       # returns immediately
dibbla wf execute weather --data '{"question":"…"}' --follow      # tail + final output
dibbla wf execute weather --file payload.json --follow
```

**Agent guidance:** prefer `--follow` for interactive debugging — you get live operational logs and the final api_response payload in one command. Use `--async` when dispatching many runs to inspect later via `wf runs list` + `wf runs output`. The default sync mode is fine for short, deterministic workflows but blocks the agent's terminal until the api_response fires.

### workflows url

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla workflows url <name>` |
| **Arguments** | `name` (required) |
| **Flags** | `--revision` — URL for a specific revision |
| **Output** | Plain URL (default); JSON/YAML with `-o` |

### workflows api-docs

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla workflows api-docs <name>` |
| **Arguments** | `name` (required) |
| **Flags** | `--revision` — docs for a specific revision |
| **Output** | Human-readable endpoint docs (default); JSON/YAML with `-o` |

### workflows logs

Tail structured operational logs for a workflow run. Logs are emitted by both `workflow-server` (orchestration) and `go-toolserver` (function/agent execution) and tagged with `run`, `workflow`, `node`, `level`, and `src`. Wire format matches `dibbla logs` (NDJSON over chunked HTTP) so the same renderer is reused.

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla workflows logs <runId>` |
| **Arguments** | `runId` (required) — run id from a previous `wf execute` response or `wf runs list` |
| **Flags** | `--since <duration>` — backfill window for persisted entries (default `15m`) |
| | `-f`, `--follow` — keep the connection open; live entries stream until the run completes (server emits a `run_completed` sentinel) or you Ctrl-C |
| | `-n`, `--tail <N>` — show only the last N persisted entries (instead of the `--since` window) |
| | `--level <debug\|info\|warn\|error>` — minimum level to print (default `info`) |
| | `--json` — emit raw NDJSON instead of the human format |
| | `--no-color` — disable color output |
| **Behavior** | Finished runs short-circuit to historic-only and exit immediately — no waiting on a stream that has nothing to deliver. Live runs follow until `run_completed`. |
| **Persistence model** | WARN/ERROR + the `run_completed` sentinel are persisted to the database. INFO/DEBUG are live-only (no DB row). Tailing a quiet finished run will show essentially just `run completed`. |
| **Errors** | 404 if the run is not in the caller's organisation. |

**Examples:**
```
dibbla wf logs 020b1341-…                     # historic backfill (mostly WARN/ERROR)
dibbla wf logs 020b1341-… --follow             # live tail until the run completes
dibbla wf logs 020b1341-… --level debug -f     # see everything, including INFO/DEBUG
dibbla wf logs 020b1341-… --json | jq '.line'  # NDJSON for scripting
```

**Agent guidance:** for an in-flight run, `--follow` is the equivalent of `dibbla logs -f` for deployed apps — it's the primary "what is the workflow doing right now" view. For a finished run, the most useful artefact is usually `wf runs output <runId>` (the api_response payload), not the logs — INFO/DEBUG aren't persisted, so a clean run's historic tail is essentially empty.

---

## runs

Inspect workflow runs independent of any specific workflow command — useful when you have a run id but don't want to look up the workflow first, or when listing recent runs across all workflows.

### runs list

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla wf runs list` |
| **Flags** | `-w`, `--workflow <name>` — filter by workflow name (matches both `name` and the `name/HEAD` canonical form) |
| | `-n`, `--limit <N>` — max rows (default 50, server caps at 500) |
| **Output** | Table (`ID`, `WORKFLOW`, `STARTED`) by default; JSON or YAML with `-o`. |

**Examples:**
```
dibbla wf runs list                       # 50 most recent runs across all workflows
dibbla wf runs list -w chat_agent         # only chat_agent runs
dibbla wf runs list -n 200 -o json        # raw JSON, scriptable
```

### runs output

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla wf runs output <runId>` |
| **Arguments** | `runId` (required) — id of a finished run |
| **Output** | JSON object: the api_response payload merged with `response_metadata`. Same shape as a synchronous `wf execute` response. |
| **Errors** | 404 if the run isn't in the caller's organisation, hasn't reached an api_response yet, or the workflow has no api_response node. |

**Examples:**
```
dibbla wf runs output 020b1341-…
dibbla wf runs output 020b1341-… -o yaml
```

**Agent guidance:** the canonical async loop is `wf execute --async` → capture the run id from `response_metadata.run` → `wf logs <runId> -f` for live progress → `wf runs output <runId>` for the final payload. When the user asks "what did this run actually return", this is the command — `wf logs` is operational, not product output.

## nodes

> All `nodes` / `edges` / `inputs` / `tools` commands patch the workflow's HEAD revision. They do **not** auto-snapshot — pair risky patch sequences with `dibbla revisions create <workflow>` before and after for safe rollback.

### nodes add

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla nodes add <workflow>` |
| **Arguments** | `workflow` (required) — target workflow name |
| **Flags** | `--file`, `-f` — node definition file (YAML/JSON) |
| | `--inline` — inline node definition (JSON string) |
| **Rule** | Either `--file` or `--inline` is required |

### nodes remove

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla nodes remove <workflow> <node_id>` |
| **Arguments** | `workflow` (required), `node_id` (required) |
| **Flags** | `--yes` — skip confirmation |

---

## edges

### edges add

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla edges add <workflow> "<src.port -> tgt.port>"` |
| **Arguments** | `workflow` (required), edge spec (required) |

### edges remove

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla edges remove <workflow> "<src.port -> tgt.port>"` |
| **Arguments** | `workflow` (required), edge spec (required) |

### edges list

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla edges list <workflow>` |
| **Arguments** | `workflow` (required) |
| **Output** | Table (default); JSON/YAML with `-o` |

---

## inputs

### inputs set

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla inputs set <workflow> <node> <input> <value>` |
| **Arguments** | `workflow`, `node`, `input`, `value` (all required) |
| **Flags** | `--null` — set value to null instead of string |

---

## tools

### tools add

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla tools add <workflow> <agent> <tool>` |
| **Arguments** | `workflow`, `agent` (node ID), `tool` (all required) |

### tools remove

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla tools remove <workflow> <agent> <tool>` |
| **Arguments** | `workflow`, `agent` (node ID), `tool` (all required) |

---

## revisions

Alias: `rev`.

### revisions list

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla revisions list <workflow>` |
| **Arguments** | `workflow` (required) |
| **Output** | Table: ID, TIMESTAMP, LABEL (default); JSON/YAML with `-o` |

### revisions create

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla revisions create <workflow>` |
| **Arguments** | `workflow` (required) |
| **Output** | Revision ID (with `-q` prints only the ID) |

### revisions restore

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla revisions restore <workflow> <revision_id>` |
| **Arguments** | `workflow` (required), `revision_id` (required) |
| **Behavior** | Makes `<revision_id>` the new HEAD by overwriting the current HEAD. **Not** a checkout — once HEAD is overwritten, the previous HEAD is lost unless it had been snapshotted. Always run `revisions create` first if the current HEAD is worth keeping. |

---

## functions

Alias: `fn`.

### functions list

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla functions list` |
| **Flags** | `--server` — filter by server name |
| | `--tag` — filter by tag |
| **Output** | Table: NAME, SERVER, DESCRIPTION, TOOLS (default); JSON/YAML with `-o` |

### functions get

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Usage** | `dibbla functions get <server> <name>` |
| **Arguments** | `server` (required), `name` (required) |
| **Output** | YAML (default) or JSON with `-o json`. The `inputs` and `outputs` blocks include each field's actual Go-reflected type: `boolean`, `integer`, `float`, or `string`. |

**Agent guidance:** since the field-types fix, `fn get` is the **trusted source of truth** for input/output types. Older cached output (or pre-fix workflow YAML files saved to disk) may report everything as `string`; treat post-fix `fn get` as authoritative, and reach for the function source at `go-toolserver/functions/<name>/function.go` if `fn get` and a workflow's hardcoded type still disagree. Mismatched types fail at runtime with `cannot unmarshal X into Go struct field Inputs.Y of type Z`.
